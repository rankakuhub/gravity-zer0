Retro 3D
--------

Retro 3D is a shader that provides low grade 3D graphics,
which resembles the first generation of 3D consoles like
PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Basically, it's a kind of
unlit shader, but also reduces the precision of geometric
operations, and cancels the perspective correction for
texture mapping.
